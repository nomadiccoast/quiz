      "answer": "0, 1.25",
      "explanation": "The Lewis structure of PO43- shows that there are 4 equivalent oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom has 3 lone pairs and one bond with phosphorus. Formal charge on an atom in a Lewis structure is defined as: Formal charge = (number of valence electrons in free atom) - (number of non-bonding electrons) - (1/2)(number of bonding electrons) For oxygen: Formal charge = 6 - 6 - (1/2)(2) = 0 The phosphorus atom has 5 valence electrons. It is bonded to 4 oxygen atoms. So, it has 8 electrons. Formal charge on P = 5 - 0 - (1/2) (8) = 0 The bond order of P-O bond can be calculated by: Bond order = (number of bonds between P and O) / (total number of bonds) PO43- has 4 P-O bonds. The total number of bonds = 4. The bond order = 4/4 = 1.25 (or 4/4 * (6/4) = 1.25 if calculated through another method)"
